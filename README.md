GenesisIV

GenesisIV is a web-based application designed to simulate and visualize the amplification process of a Free-Electron Laser (FEL). Leveraging modern web technologies, it provides an interactive platform for users to explore FEL dynamics in a 3D environment.

Features

3D Visualization: Interactive 3D models to visualize the amplification process.

Real-Time Simulation: Simulate FEL amplification dynamics in real-time.

User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive controls for an enhanced user experience.

Technologies Used

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

3D Rendering: WebGL, Three.js

Build Tool: Vite

Installation

To run GenesisIV locally:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Aradhana2602/GenesisIV.git


Navigate into the project directory:

cd GenesisIV


Install dependencies:

npm install


Start the development server:

npm run dev


The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Usage

Upon launching the application, users can interact with the 3D model to observe and understand the FEL amplification process. Controls are provided to manipulate the simulation parameters and view different stages of amplification.
